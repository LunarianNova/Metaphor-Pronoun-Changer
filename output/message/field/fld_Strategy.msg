A misstep here would cost us a means to save Her Highness... We'll need you to make a prudent decision, <HERO_NAME>.

A fair proposal, but I believe we should focus on gathering support now. Saving the princess will be for nought if someone else pilfers the throne.

We'll just have to prepare however we can, dearies. Rallying support for the princess couldn't hurt either.
